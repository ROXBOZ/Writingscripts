        <h2>Who is A11Y?</h2>
        <p>
          Web accessibility (or A11Y) allows people with disabilities - visual,
          auditory or cognitive - permanent or temporary - to navigate the web
          easily. The
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">
            WCAG 2.1 AA standards<span class="screen-reader-text"
              >(open a new tab)</span
            >
          </a>
          (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) define a whole series of
          principles to be applied in order to ensure a perceptible, usable and
          understandable web for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web accessibility is web inclusion. Code, design and content have to
          meets some standards for a website to be accessible. Web Accessibility
          increases the user experience â€“ everyone should benefit from it.
        </p>

        <h2>Accessibility & Writing systems</h2>
        <p>
          Good practice in web typography and web accessibility means well
          adjusted CSS settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, different writing systems mean different CSS adjustments. To
          mention just a few examples, paragraphs are commonly set at 16px in
          Latin, but the Arabic writing system needs 18px to reach satisfying
          readibility. Vietnamese is based on the latin writing system, but its
          accented glyphs can be much taller than those found in Western
          European languages; for this reason, it needs extra line-height to
          maintain readability. Cyrillic on the other hand adapts well to latin
          CSS settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most websites hosted in Europe and the Americas translated in writing
          systems other than Latin are not set correctly. As a result, the user
          experience drops drastically, when switching the language.
        </p>

        <h2>Language directions</h2>
        <p>
          Content are translated and, when the direction of the language
          changes, the layout must get inverted. However, most of the time, the
          layout keeps following the left-to-right logic in all languages (menu
          remains top right, logo remains top left, etc). An inclusive
          multilingual website should see its layout reverted to be correctly
          adapted to right-to-left writing scripts. It includes menus, tables,
          forms, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, not only the design but also the code has to be
          adaped; when navigating the website with a keyboard, the tab focus
          should follow the direction of the language.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website aims to become a ressourceful tool when designing
          multilingual websites. For now, it's just a beginning.
